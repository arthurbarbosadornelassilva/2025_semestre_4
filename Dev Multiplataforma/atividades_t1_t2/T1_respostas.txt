        E. Variables and methods

Section 2

11.  When line 10 is executed, which method will be called? 
1.   class Account { 
2.   public void deposit(int amt, int amt1) { } 
3.   public void deposit(int amt){ } 
4.   } 
5.   public class CreditAccount extends Account { 
6.   public void deposit() { } 
7.   public void deposit(int amt) {} 
8.   public static void main(String args[]){ 
9.   Account account = new CreditAccount(); 
10. account.deposit(10); 
11. } 
12. }

12.  True or False:  The instanceof operator allows you to determine the type of an object.  
       
        A.  True 
         
 
13.  True or False:  The instanceof operator can find subclass objects when they are passed to 
methods which declare a superclass type parameter.  
        
        A.  True 
        
 
14.  True or False:  Calling a subclass method by referring to a superclass works because you 
have access to all specialized methods through virtual method invocation. 
         
        B.  False


15.  What is special about including a resource in a try statement? (Choose Two) 
        A.  An error will be thrown if the resources does not open

19.  Which of the following statements is false? 
 
        C.  An ArrayList has a fixed length 


20.  Which of the following is not a good technique to follow when reading code written by 
others? 
 
        C.  Learn the high level structure and starting point, and then figure out how it branches 

Section 3

21.  Which of the following is a sorting algorithm that involves repeatedly incrementing through 
the array and swapping 2 adjacent values if they are in the wrong order until all elements are 
in the correct order? 
        
        B.  Bubble Sort 
        

22.  Which of the following is a sorting algorithm that utilizes a "divide and conquer" technique to 
sort arrays with optimal speed? 
         
        C.  Merge Sort  
        

23.  Which searching algorithm involves using a low, middle, and high index value to find the 
location of a value in a sorted set of data (if it exists)? 
        
        A.  Binary Search 


24.  True or False:  Binary searches can be performed on sorted and unsorted data.  
        
        A.  True 
        
 
25.  True or False:  A sequential search is an iteration through the array that stops at the index 
where the desired element is found.  
        
        B.  False 
 

26.  True or False:  Stacks are identical to Queues.  
 
        B.  False

28.  Which statements, if inserted it at line 2, will ensure that the code snippet will compile 
successfully?  (Choose Two) 
        1.  public static void main (String[]args)    { 
        2.  //insert code here 
        3.  s.put ("StudentID", 123); 
        4.  } 
                 
                B.  HashMap s= new HashMap();  
                D.  SortedMap s= new TreeMap(); 
 
29.  True or False:  A HashMap can only store String types.  
         
        B.  False
