Test: JP Java Programming Midterm Exam

Section 1 

1. What is the output from the following code? 
    String s= "a,b,c"; 
    Scanner sc = new Scanner (s); 
    while  (sc.hasNext()) 
        System.out.print (sc.next()  +" "); 
        
        D.  a,b,c


2. What is the output from the following code snippet? 
    int i=0,j=0; 
    i=++i; 
    j=i++; 
    System.out.println("i=" + i + " " + "j=" + j); 
     
        C.  The code will compile and print "i=2 j=1" 


3. True or False:  The following code can be compiled.

        D.  public abstract class Student{}


5. Which two statements prevent a method from being overridden? (Choose Two)

        B.  final void act() {} 
        C.  static final void act() {} 


6. What is the output from the following code snippet? 
    String str1= "java"; 
    String str2=new String("java");
    System.out.println( str1==str2 );
    System.out.println( str1==str2.intern() );

        B.  The code will compile and print "false true"


7. Which combination of the following overload the Student constructor? (Choose Two) 
        
        C.  public Student(){} 
        D.  public Student(int x,int y){} 


8. True or False:  You can only implement one interface in a class.  
        
        B.  False 


9. True or False:  Immutable classes can be subclassed.  
        
        B. False
        

10.  Interfaces define what? 
        
        E. Variables and methods

Section 2

11.  When line 10 is executed, which method will be called? 
1.   class Account { 
2.   public void deposit(int amt, int amt1) { } 
3.   public void deposit(int amt){ } 
4.   } 
5.   public class CreditAccount extends Account { 
6.   public void deposit() { } 
7.   public void deposit(int amt) {} 
8.   public static void main(String args[]){ 
9.   Account account = new CreditAccount(); 
10. account.deposit(10); 
11. } 
12. } 
       
        D.  Line 7


12.  True or False:  The instanceof operator allows you to determine the type of an object.  
       
        A.  True 
         
 
13.  True or False:  The instanceof operator can find subclass objects when they are passed to 
methods which declare a superclass type parameter.  
        
        A.  True 
        
 
14.  True or False:  Calling a subclass method by referring to a superclass works because you 
have access to all specialized methods through virtual method invocation. 
         
        B.  False


15.  What is special about including a resource in a try statement? (Choose Two) 
        A.  An error will be thrown if the resources does not open
