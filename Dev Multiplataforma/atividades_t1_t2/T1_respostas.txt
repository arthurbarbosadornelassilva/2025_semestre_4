Section 1 

1. What is the output from the following code? 
    String s= "a,b,c"; 
    Scanner sc = new Scanner (s); 
    while  (sc.hasNext()) 
        System.out.print (sc.next()  +" "); 
        
        D.  a,b,c


2. What is the output from the following code snippet? 
    int i=0,j=0; 
    i=++i; 
    j=i++; 
    System.out.println("i=" + i + " " + "j=" + j); 
     
        C.  The code will compile and print "i=2 j=1" 


3. True or False:  The following code can be compiled.

        B.  False


4. Which of the following declarations are wrong? (Choose Three)

        A.  abstract final class Hello{} 
        B.  abstract private void act(){}

5. Which two statements prevent a method from being overridden? (Choose Two)

        B.  final void act() {} 
        C.  static final void act() {} 


6. What is the output from the following code snippet? 
    String str1= "java"; 
    String str2=new String("java");
    System.out.println( str1==str2 );
    System.out.println( str1==str2.intern() );

        B.  The code will compile and print "false true"


7. Which combination of the following overload the Student constructor? (Choose Two) 
        
        C.  public Student(){} 
        D.  public Student(int x,int y){} 


8. True or False:  You can only implement one interface in a class.  
        
        B.  False 


9. True or False:  Immutable classes can be subclassed.  
        
        B. False
        

10.  Interfaces define what? 
        
        E. Variables and methods
